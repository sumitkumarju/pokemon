# pokemon

This is a pokemon classifier python project.This algorithm takes input different RGB pokemon images process it into 100X100 pixels grayscale images.
K-nn (k nearest neighbours) algorithm runs on this processed images and prediction are made.
This algorithm has a accuracy of 78%.

This code is 100% sumit.
